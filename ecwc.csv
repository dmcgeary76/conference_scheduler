Suitable for the classroom, car or living room, his upbeat brand of children’s music has been delighting students, teachers and parents around the nation for more than three decades.  

He realized his love for music at a very young age while listening to Beatles LP’s at his Aunt’s house shortly after the British Band Invasion of the 60’s.
As a result, he shares that same passion for song with teachers and children through his writing, recording and performance.

Since the mid 80s, Stephen has performed concerts for over 850,000 children, as well as, keynotes and workshops for educators in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Virginia.  

Stephen’s Concerts
Stephen’s shows have been described as an “interactive celebration of music and learning.”  Geared for ages 3 to 7 years, Stephen combines a solid hour of music and movement with generous helpings of rhythm, repetition and rhyme to create a festive buffet of entertainment and fun.  For children, the concert experience is exciting and motivating, as they become active participants from the opening song.  For teachers and parents, it is both relaxing and inspirational as they sit back (if they can stay in their seat) and enjoy the children’s individual performances.

,Dr. Vicki Gibson,,Gibson Hasbrouck & Associates,,Simple Tools for Understanding Revised Texas Pre-Kindergarten Guidelines,"The revised Texas Prekindergarten Guidelines and recently released TEA PreK Breakouts include end-of-year (EOY) learning outcomes that affect changes in classroom practices.
